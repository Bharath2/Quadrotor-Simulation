## Quadrotor simulation

### This project contains:
1. Informed RRT* to plan a collision free path from start to goal position in an N-dimensional Map.
2. A minimum snap trajectory generator. The segment times between consecutive waypoints are also optimised.
3. Nonlinear geometric controller for aggressive trajectory tracking and hover controller
4. Quadrotor Simulator

### Usage

### Future Work

1. Adding disturbance to quadrotor model
2. Collision checking after trajectory generation
